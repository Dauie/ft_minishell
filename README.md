## Minishell

This project's goal was to implement a basic command-line shell in C using my libft.
It's built-in features include the following commands: CD, ECHO, UNSETENV,
SETENV & ENV. All other commands are found using the path environment variable 
and executed accordingly.

Future iterations of my shell will include piping, redirection, and autocomplete.
